# MP3
Medical software for Processing multi-Parametric images Pipelines

**MP³** is an open source software aimed to support medical researchers all along their studies. Indeed, MP³ offers a graphical interface to convert, visualize, compute and analyze medical images. It allows to use well known processes or to develop yours and to apply them in complex pipelines. All the post processing you used to apply on each subset of your data can now be stored, reproduced and parallelized. Although it was initially developed  for MRI data, this software can be used for all medical images that matches one of the required formats. It has for example been used on scanner data. MP³ has been developed at the Grenoble Institute of Neurosciences, in France.
